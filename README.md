## Usage

Preparation is needed before you are able to generate XJB, as the static source code,
i.e. the code of XJB which is not generated from the XML protocol descriptions provided by xcbproto,
relies on JDK functionality which is not yet released to the public, namely support for Unix sockets.

This support is implemented in the `unixdomainchannels` branch of the
[JDK sandbox](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/sandbox/), which is currently based on an incomplete version of
Java 15.

For more information about the `unixdomainchannels` branch see
[this issue on the JDK bug system](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8231358).

For instructions on how to build the JDK from source see
[this document](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8231358).

## Implementation notes

### JAXB implementation

The project is not tightly coupled to Eclipse MOXy and a different JAXB implementation should be
usable by removing all MOXy-specific functionality, which, at the time of writing, only concerns
`@XmlValueExtension`.

Because `@XmlValueExtension` is only used internally for backwards compatibility with EclipseLink
2.5.0, the project does not depend on any vendor-specific extensions.

Additionally, the `jaxb.properties` file needs to be removed or adjusted when switching JAXB
implementations.
